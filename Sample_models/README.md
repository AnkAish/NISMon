# Classifier Model output files

This folder contains three `models.pkl` files that have been generated for my system. This also includes the file `evaluate_all_models.py` that outputs the trade-off CSV file for all the models on the dataset generated from a controlled experiment (generated by the `metrics_collector` suite).

I have also included the folder `models_comparison` that shows the trade-offs of all three models.
