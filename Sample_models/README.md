# Classifier Model output files

This folder contains three `models.pkl` files that have been generated for my system. This also contains the file `evaluate_all_models.py` that outputs the trade-off CSV file for all the models on the dataset that has been generated from a controlled experiment (generated by the `metrics_collector` suite).
